#  Instagram Reach Analysis and Engagement Prediction

This project explores and analyzes Instagram data to identify trends, user engagement patterns, and factors that contribute to reach. It uses various data visualization and machine learning tools to gain insights from the dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: `InstagramData.csv`
- **Goal**: Analyze and visualize the factors that impact user engagement and content reach on Instagram.

##  Key Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using:
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Plotly
  - WordClouds
- Correlation analysis
- Feature engineering and selection

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `wordcloud`
- `scikit-learn`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly wordcloud scikit-learn
```

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Place the `InstagramData.csv` file in the same directory.
3. Launch the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook reach-analysis.ipynb
```

##  Example Outputs

- Heatmaps and bar charts showing engagement metrics
- Word clouds of common captions
- Visual correlations between features and reach

## Future Work

- Apply classification or regression models to predict reach
- Test additional feature engineering techniques
- Analyze time-series engagement patterns
